## About this journal

Arawi Aura is a personal poetry log kept since 2017.  
The word _arawi_ in Quechua means _poem_, and _aura_ is the breeze that carries it.

Here you will find words that remember mountains, rivers, and small daily miracles.  
Feel free to read, listen, or translateâ€”poetry belongs to everyone.

If you wish to share your own breeze, [get in touch](/en/contact/).
