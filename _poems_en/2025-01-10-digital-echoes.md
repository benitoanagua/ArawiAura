In the quiet hum of servers,  
where ones and zeros dance,  
I find your digital traces—  
a fingerprint on glass.

The algorithm remembers  
what my heart tries to forget:  
your favorite songs playing  
in coffee shops I've never visited.

We live in parallel timelines,  
your profile smiling in feeds  
I scroll past at 3 AM,  
seeking connection in the blue light.

Memory becomes data,  
data becomes memory,  
until the difference blurs  
between what was real  
and what the machine suggests.

Yet in this digital ocean,  
I still search for your shore—  
a human signal  
in the noise of progress.
