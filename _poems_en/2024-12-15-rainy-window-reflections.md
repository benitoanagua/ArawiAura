Rain paints abstract art  
on window panes—  
each drop a lens  
distorting the world  
into something beautiful.

Streetlights bleed  
into watercolor streaks,  
cars become smears of light,  
people blur into shadows  
dancing on glass.

I trace paths of water  
with my finger,  
following rivers  
down the transparent map,  
wondering if this is how  
the world looks to rain—  
soft, impressionistic,  
forgiving of sharp edges.

The window separates  
but also connects—  
I am inside, warm,  
watching the world  
through nature's filter,  
seeing reality  
as it might be remembered  
in dreams.

Each drop contains  
a miniature world,  
inverted and perfect,  
until gravity pulls it down  
to join the collective  
flow toward earth.
