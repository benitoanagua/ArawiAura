Dust motes dance  
in golden light shafts—  
each particle a word  
from books breathing  
their stories to empty air.

The library sleeps,  
but books are awake,  
whispering to each other  
across wooden shelves,  
sharing secrets  
between leather covers.

I walk these aisles  
like a ghost among thoughts,  
running fingers along spines  
feeling the vibration  
of captured voices  
waiting to be read.

Each book is a door  
to someone's mind,  
a time machine  
to moments preserved  
in ink and paper,  
a conversation across centuries  
with the dead and living.

The silence here is loud—  
filled with the weight  
of all the words  
never spoken aloud,  
all the stories  
waiting patiently  
for curious eyes to find them.
