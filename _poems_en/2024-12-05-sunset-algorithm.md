The sky executes  
its sunset algorithm—  
variables of light,  
functions of color,  
rendering beauty  
at 60 frames per second.

Clouds render first,  
soft and volumetric,  
then the gradient begins:  
hex codes shifting  
from blue to orange  
to pink to purple,  
each pixel calculated  
by cosmic processor.

I watch this display,  
this natural simulation,  
wondering if somewhere  
in the universe,  
a developer is debugging  
the twilight code,  
adjusting parameters  
for tomorrow's performance.

The sun dips below horizon—  
the final render complete,  
leaving us with  
the afterglow,  
the ambient occlusion  
that makes night feel gentle.

Nature's UI is perfect,  
no bugs in the system,  
every sunset unique  
yet familiar,  
a daily reminder  
that the best design  
feels effortless.
