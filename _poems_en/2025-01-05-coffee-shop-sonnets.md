Steam rises from ceramic mugs  
like prayers to the morning—  
each table an island,  
each laptop a shield.

We sit together, alone,  
in this cathedral of caffeine,  
where baristas are priests  
and the espresso machine  
chants its liturgy.

The woman in the corner  
writes letters by hand—  
a rebellion against screens,  
ink bleeding into paper  
like secrets told in confidence.

Two students share textbooks,  
their shoulders touching  
accidentally, then not,  
the space between them  
charged with possibility.

I watch these strangers,  
collect their stories,  
turn them into fourteen lines  
of borrowed intimacy,  
temporary connections  
dissolving with the last drop.
