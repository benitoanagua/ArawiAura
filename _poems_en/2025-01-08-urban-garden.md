Concrete cracks open  
like mouths hungry for light—  
a dandelion's yellow defiance  
blooms where sidewalks meet.

In this city of steel,  
nature writes its own poetry  
in the language of survival:  
roots breaking foundations,  
leaves reaching for sun  
through layers of smog.

I watch ants carry crumbs  
across asphalt highways,  
witness birds build nests  
in electrical wires,  
hear crickets sing  
their nightly songs  
to sleeping buildings.

The garden grows wild  
in forgotten corners—  
morning glory climbing brick walls,  
mushrooms pushing through soil  
contaminated by progress.

Even in this urban desert,  
life insists on existing,  
teaching us that beauty  
doesn't need permission  
to bloom where it's planted.
