Steel snake through darkness,  
carrying stories home—  
each face a chapter  
I'll never finish reading.

The train rocks gently,  
a lullaby for the weary,  
while advertisements flash  
promises of better lives  
no one quite believes.

A musician plays guitar  
in the space between cars,  
his case open like a heart,  
collecting coins and smiles  
from passengers too tired  
to look up from phones.

We are temporary family,  
these strangers in motion,  
bound by destination  
and the shared understanding  
that this moment,  
like all moments,  
will arrive and depart.

The doors open, close—  
some stories exit, new ones enter,  
and the metro keeps running,  
underground river  
flowing through the city's  
sleeping veins.
