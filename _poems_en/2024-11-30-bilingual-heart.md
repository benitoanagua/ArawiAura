description: "Living between two languages, where translation becomes an act of love and memory."

My heart speaks two tongues—  
English for logic and work,  
Spanish for dreams and love,  
each word a bridge  
between worlds I inhabit.

In English, I count coins,  
schedule meetings, sign forms,  
the language of efficiency,  
of clear communication,  
of getting things done.

In Spanish, I remember  
grandmother's kitchen smells,  
the taste of mango in summer,  
the way poetry flows  
like warm honey from tongue.

Sometimes I forget  
which language I'm thinking in,  
words mixing like paint  
on a palette, creating  
new colors only I understand.

Translation is not just changing words—  
it's carrying meaning  
across borders,  
finding home in foreign sounds,  
recognizing yourself in others.

I am two people in one body,  
each complete,  
each missing something  
only the other can provide—  
a puzzle solved by speaking both.
