# **Arawi Aura: Lyrical Visions** 🌿✨

## 📜 _Where Verse Meets Essence_

A curated collection of lyrical poetry, blending traditional forms with contemporary whispers, wrapped in an mdbook of serene elegance.

## 🌌 **About This Project**

**Arawi Aura** is a poetic duality:

- **Arawi** (Quechua for _"poem"_) anchors the collection in ancestral rhythm.
- **Aura** (Greek for _"breeze"_) carries the intangible—the fleeting muse.

Together, they invite readers to wander between structure and ether.
